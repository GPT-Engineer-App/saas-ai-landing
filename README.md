A landing page for a SaaS business built around this:

import transformers
import blackboxai

model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Set up the Blackbox.ai API client
blackbox_client.Client.from_api_key(os.environ["BLACKBOX_API_KEY"])

# Define the user interface for the app

    last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state

    # Return the last hidden state as a string
    return last_hidden_states.detach().numpy().tolist()

iface = gr.Interface(fn=run_model, inputs="text", outputs="text")

# Define the GitHub bot functions
